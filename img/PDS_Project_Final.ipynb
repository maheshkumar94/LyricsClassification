    "Music Classification is a fairly common topic, and there are many ways to classify songs on features like danceability, energy, tempo, etc. Indeed, classifying songs on these features is so commonplace that commercial music streaming services like Spotify provide an off the shelf solution to retrieve these audio features, and others like\n",

    "These are audio features that are readily available for use through the Spotify API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We differentiate our classification by one fundamental change - Lyrics. Every genre has several issues/subjects that it tackles. By identifying these topics as most frequently occurring words, we're able to accurately classify songs that deal with similar topics and contain similar words."
